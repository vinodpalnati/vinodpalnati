I'm a passionate and skilled Graduate with a focus on Linux, SQL, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). With a strong foundation in these technologies,
I'm dedicated to building robust and secure software solutions that drive innovation and efficiency.

🌐 Tech Stack:

Operating System: Linux is my playground, and I thrive on harnessing its power to develop and manage complex systems.

Database: SQL is where data comes to life. I excel at designing, optimizing, and querying relational databases to make data-driven decisions a reality.

Cloud: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is my expertise. I architect secure and scalable AWS environments, leveraging IAM best practices to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
